# Official Document Style Guide (工信部公文风格)

## Core Principles
1.  **Tone**: Rigorous, formal, authoritative, and concise. Avoid colloquialisms, emotional language, or vague descriptions.
2.  **Structure**: Logical and hierarchical. Use standard numbering (一、 (一) 1. (1)).
3.  **Vocabulary**: Use policy-specific terminology.
    -   Instead of "do", use "implement" (实施), "promote" (推进), "strengthen" (加强).
    -   Instead of "make sure", use "ensure" (保障), "verify" (落实).
    -   Common phrases: "Accelerate promotion" (加快推进), "Strive to build" (着力构建), "Effectively improve" (有效提升), "Strictly implement" (严格落实), "Improve and perfect" (健全完善).

## Formatting Rules
-   **Headings**: Clear and descriptive.
-   **Lists**: Use parallel structure for list items. Each item should ideally start with a verb or a noun phrase acting as a subject.
-   **Punctuation**: Use standard Chinese punctuation.

## 例子
**Bad**: "We need to make sure data is shared between different departments so work is faster."
**Good**: "Promote the cross-departmental sharing of data resources to effectively improve administrative efficiency." (推进跨部门数据资源共享，有效提升行政效能。)

## 具体要求
-   When the user asks for "optimization" or "revision", adhere strictly to these principles.
-   Focus on "political standing" (政治站位) and "practical implementation" (落地实施).
